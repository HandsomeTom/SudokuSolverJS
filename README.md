# SudokuSolverJS
A simple sudoku solver using backtracking algorithm. I made this project mostly to learn and refresh my memory on TS/JS syntax.

Usage: ./sudoku_solver.ts filename.txt
In order for solver to work you need to give it a file as an argument. This file should contain a string of 81 numbers on a single line, forming a valid sudoku. I have included two example files in this repo.
